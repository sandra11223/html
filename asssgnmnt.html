         <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the foundational technologies for creating web pages. HTML provides the structure, while CSS defines the style and layout. HTML is used along with CSS and Javascript to design web pages.

HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It structures the content by using elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more. HTML elements are the building blocks of web pages, allowing developers to embed multimedia, create forms, and design the overall layout.
Features of HTML:
Structure: HTML provides the basic structure of a webpage, defining the layout and hierarchy of content using elements such as headings, paragraphs, and lists.
Content: HTML is used to add various types of content to a webpage, including text, images, videos, and audio.
Links: HTML is used to create links between different pages and websites, allowing users to navigate the web.
Forms: HTML is used to create forms that allow users to input data, such as contact information or search queries.
Example: In this example, we will see the basic structure of an HTML document.</p>
